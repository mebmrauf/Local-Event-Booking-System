# Local Event Booking System

## Concept

A system for booking tickets to local events like concerts and sports games. Users can select events, choose how many tickets they want (up to 5\) and add extras like parking passes. The system calculates the total price and applies discounts.

3. Ticket Quantity Input: Allow purchase of maximum 5 tickets per event  
4. Event Code Selection: Take input for event codes (For example, "C" for concert)  
5. Display Error Message: When ticket quantity exceeds 5  
6. Display Error Message: When an invalid event code is entered  
7. Extras Selection: Allow selection of add-ons (parking, merchandise, VIP upgrade)  
8. Calculate Total Bill: Based on event type, quantity, and extras  
9. Group Discount Application: Apply 15% discount for 3+ tickets  
10. Show Customer Total Bill: Display itemized bill with discount applied  
11. Coupon Code Redemption: Allow entering coupon codes for additional discount

## Why It's Important

We picked this project because it solves a real problem people face when booking event tickets while letting us show off what we've learned about assembly programming. Working with money calculations and user choices in assembly language gives us valuable skills that matter in the real world.
