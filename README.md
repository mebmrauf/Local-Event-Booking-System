# 🎟️ Local Event Booking System

A text-based based Local Event Booking System written in **Intel 8086 Assembly**, allowing users to book tickets for concerts, sports games, and workshops. Built to simulate real-world event booking logic using low-level programming principles, this project demonstrates essential concepts such as input validation, conditional logic, price calculation, and discount application.

## 💡 Educational Purpose

This system simulates a real-world application while showcasing:

* Use of **registers** and **memory management**
* User **input handling** via keyboard interrupts
* **Arithmetic operations** and logic flow control
* Conditional branching and looping in **8086 Assembly**

By building this system from the ground up, we explored how simple real-world problems can be handled with low-level hardware logic.
